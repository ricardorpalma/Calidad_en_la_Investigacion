With the 4th indus-
trial revolution, new technologies, such as artificial intelligence, cloud computing, 3D
printers and the Internet of Things started to take greater prominence in the world
of business. One of the sectors affected by the process that started with Industry
4.0 is logistics. For that reason, a concept called Logistics 4.0 has emerged. 

 In this context, a modern production model called “light out factory” or in certain cases
“Smart Factory” is emerging (Banger 2016)

The rules for Distribution Centers (DC) to enable Industry 4.0 applications are as
follows (Taliaferro et al. 2016):

*  **Meet the current requirements in supply** Automation with Industry 4.0 can
be helpful. This technology can be used to significantly reduce costs and risks.
Technological advancements can have important results beyond current skills.

* **Develop strategies** for finding skills DCs that adopt the technology of Industry
4.0 have to evaluate what they can do from today in order to find the skills that
can be supported for potentially higher levels of automation.

* **Follow the trends** Examine the new opportunities to improve distribution opera-
tions and gather competitive intelligence to monitor potential marketing threats.
This will provide efficient planning and decision making over the next 10 years.

* **Plan for data management**, credibility and security Plan for data management,
credibility and security in systems that get more and more complex, including
data management systems and the application of Industry 4.0 technologies. Data
management systems are important for the application of Industry 4.0 tech-
nologies, as they are very important in gathering, analyzing, applying data and
preserving skills.
